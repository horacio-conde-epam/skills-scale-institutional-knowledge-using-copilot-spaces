# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome! This README centralizes the core project management process documents for OctoAcme. These resources are intended to make project execution consistent, traceable, and accessible for new team members and stakeholders. Use this as your single entry point to understand the lifecycle, roles, key artifacts, and where to find templates and checklists.

OctoAcme runs projects through an iterative, artifact-driven lifecycle focused on measurable outcomes. Work starts with a Project One-pager that clarifies the problem, objective, success metrics, stakeholders, timeline, and initial risks. Approved initiatives move into planning where work is broken into prioritized backlog items with acceptance criteria and estimates, dependencies are identified, and a release/milestone plan is created.

Day-to-day execution uses a lightweight project board workflow (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done), a small-PR pull request process with CI gates, and a clear escalation path for blockers. Roles are explicit — Project Manager (delivery coordination, schedule, communications), Product Manager (outcomes, prioritization, metrics), Developers (implementation, tests, reviews), and QA (validation and acceptance) — ensuring ownership of artifacts and decisions. Communication cadence includes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, milestone demos, and stakeholder updates.

Quality assurance balances automation and manual validation: unit and integration tests, smoke/e2e checks for critical flows, CI security scans, and staged releases with rollback plans. Continuous improvement is embedded via regular retrospectives that produce tracked action items. The documents below provide phase-specific guidance, templates, and checklists for initiation, planning, execution, risk management, release, and retrospective practices.
